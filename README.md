# Vivas Schedule

This repository holds the documentation and code of the project developed for TAP (Técnicas Avançadas de Programação) curricular unit of MEI (Mestrado em Engenharia Informática) at ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto). It addresses the topic of the scheduling of MSc Disseration Defenses (entitled as Vivas) based on the availability of the jury participants (referenced as resources), following the functional programming paradigm.

The development was divided in three parts, being the first one an MVP implementation of the scheduling algorithm, the second one the assurance of the domain correctness with the use of property-based tests and the third one, a refinement to the scheduling algorithm with resources availability maximation. Additionality, coding guidelines were also defined to in order to control the quality of the code and facilitate the communication between developers.
